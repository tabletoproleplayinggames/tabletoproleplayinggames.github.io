hey so this here is a website that i'm building because i bought the url tabletoproleplaying.games and would feel like an asshole if i didn't put it to use to further the hobby.

our hobby is dominated by the bad game, and there isn't really a good resource (that i know of) that could guide someone into the wide wild world of indie tabletop rpgs.

I'd like this to be that. I want people to be able to come here not knowing much about roleplaying, or having only played dnd, and leave with a sense that there are really cool games out there that they can go buy and play.

Also, while I do feel it's necessary to point people towards the seminal texts such as Apocalypse World, Blades in the Dark, and others, I want to cultivate this into a space that helps smaller creators get noticed as well.

I don't know what the final site will look like, or how often it will be updated. I do know that I want to make something that we can all point to when the Gamers climb into people's mentions when they try to point out that there are much better games than Gary's game.
